English to Morse Code Translator (PIC16F877A)

📜 Overview
  This project is an English to Morse Code Translator implemented using Assembly Language on a PIC16F877A microcontroller. 
  It takes English text input and converts it into Morse code signals, which can be output as LED blinks or buzzer sounds.

🚀 Features
  Converts English letters and numbers into Morse code signals
  Outputs Morse code as LED blinks or buzzer sounds
  Implements Assembly Language programming for efficient microcontroller execution
  Uses PIC16F877A microcontroller for real-time processing
  PowerPoint presentation included for project explanation

🛠️ Hardware & Software Requirements
Hardware:
  PIC16F877A Microcontroller
  LEDs/Buzzer for Morse code output
  16x2 LCD Display (optional) for text output
  Push Buttons for input (if using manual input method)
  Power Supply (5V)
Software:
  MPLAB IDE (for Assembly coding & simulation)
  PIC Programmer (e.g., PICkit3) for flashing the code
  Proteus (for circuit simulation)

📌 How It Works
  The user inputs an English letter or number.
  The microcontroller converts it into Morse code (dots & dashes).
  The output is transmitted via LED blinks or buzzer beeps (short for dots, long for dashes).
  The process continues for the entire text.

🔧 Installation & Setup
  Open the MPLAB IDE and load the Assembly source code (translator.asm).
  Compile and generate the HEX file.
  Use PICkit3 or another programmer to upload the HEX file to the PIC16F877A microcontroller.
  Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.
  Power the circuit and test the Morse code output!

🏆 Future Enhancements
  Add an LCD Display to show the Morse code output
  Implement manual input using push buttons
  Improve accuracy and speed of Morse code transmission
  Add sensor that can detect morse code and convert it to english
